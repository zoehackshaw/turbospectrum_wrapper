# turbospectrum_wrapper
This repository contains my wrapper for creating synthetic spectra (although ... *shudder* python 2.7) with turbospectrum

Main things to edit when downloading and running for yourself:
- defined paths on lines 20-25
- contopac dir on line 125
- lammin, lammax, and deltalam in make_babsmabysn_file
- linelist paths on lines 255-266
- specpath on 342
- the BACCHUS paths on 375 - 406

## To Do for future Zoe:
- make generalizable
- probably update to a python version from this century
